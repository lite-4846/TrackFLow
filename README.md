# TrackFlow - Real-time Event Tracking System

TrackFlow is a distributed event tracking system designed to handle high-throughput, real-time event data processing. The system is built with a microservices architecture, leveraging Kafka for event streaming and providing robust event processing capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Docker (for Kafka and ClickHouse)
- Beaver (for database access)

### Running the Applications

1. **Start Tracker**
   ```bash
   http-server ./dist --cors -p 8080
   ```

2. **Start Backend**
   ```bash
   npm start:dev
   ```

3. **ClickHouse Setup**
   - Configure `<ip>::/0` in the ClickHouse users.d folder for Windows host access

4. **Database Access**
   ```bash
   # Use beaver for database access
   beaver
   ```
