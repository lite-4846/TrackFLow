# Plan 01: Infrastructure Setup and Verification

## Goal
Set up and verify the core infrastructure components (Kafka, Zookeeper, ClickHouse) using Docker Compose.

## Steps

### 1. Docker Compose Setup
- [ ] Verify `docker-compose.yml` configuration
- [ ] Ensure all required services are defined:
  - Zookeeper
  - Kafka
  - ClickHouse
- [ ] Check volume mappings and port configurations

### 2. Start Services
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check container logs for any startup errors

### 3. Verify Kafka
- [ ] Check if Kafka is accessible
- [ ] Create a test topic
- [ ] Verify producer/consumer functionality

### 4. Verify ClickHouse
- [ ] Connect to ClickHouse using `clickhouse-client`
- [ ] Verify database is accessible
- [ ] Check if required tables exist

### 5. Document Setup
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document any issues encountered and their solutions

## Success Criteria
- All containers start without errors
- Kafka is accessible and can produce/consume messages
- ClickHouse is accessible and can execute queries
- Basic connectivity between services is verified
